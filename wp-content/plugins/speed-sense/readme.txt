== Description ==

**AdSense Speed Sense** is an Ads management Wordpress plugin. It offers a quicker way for insert Google Adsense on your blog. Support themes standard, mobile, responsive, widgets and AMP pages. Customizable options.

In general, placing Adsense randomly within a post is a good way to experiment a variety of ads formats & placements besides optimizing your Adsense. If you have many regular visitors who frequently revisit your blog, the **randomization** will likely catch their attention.

Here are some **features** that come with this plugin:

1. Default Ads positioning: Assign Ads to the beginning of post, assign Ads to the middle of post, assign Ads to the end of post, assign Ads after 'more' tag, assign Ads before last paragraph, assign Ads after certain paragraphs (3 options available) & assign Ads after certain images.
1. Flexible Ads placement, insert Ads specifically or randomly anywhere within a post.
1. Simple configuration interface, requires no coding knowledge: Just copy and paste AdSense pub id &  Data Ad Slot, tick & select options, the plugin will then do the rest for you.  
1. Support Google Adsense Asyncronous.
1. Support Widgets for insert ads into Sidebar.
1. Support up to a maximum of 10 Ads codes for specific placement & randomization within a post.
1. Insert Ads on-the-fly, simply insert &lt;!--Ads1--&gt;, &lt;!--Ads2--&gt; ... , &lt;!--RndAds--&gt; to a post to accomplish this.
1. Disable Ads on-the-fly, simply insert &lt;!--NoAds--&gt;, &lt;!--OffDef--&gt;, &lt;!--OffWidget--&gt;, &lt;!--OffBegin--&gt; ... and more to a post to accomplish this.
1. The above Tags can be inserted into a post easily via the additional Quicktag Buttons added to the HTML Edit Post SubPanel.
1. 100% compatible with AMP plugin by Automattic.
